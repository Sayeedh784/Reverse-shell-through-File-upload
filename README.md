# Introduction

File upload vulnerabilities are a significant security concern in web applications. These vulnerabilities occur when an application allows users to upload files without properly validating their type, size, or content. If left unchecked, malicious files can be uploaded and executed on the server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or even complete takeover. The Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) serves as a controlled environment to understand, explore, and mitigate such vulnerabilities.
